# Needle-in-a-haystack long-context retrieval test.
# Adapted from vllm-project/vllm issue #47042 (GLM-5.2 sparse-MLA decode collapse),
# generalized to run against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint / model.
#
# Uses /v1/completions with stream=True + x-request-id so the MoRIIO disagg
# router injects KV routing. Raw /v1/chat/completions without these fields
# crashes the decode engine with KeyError('remote_host').
#
# Env:
#   NIAH_URL     endpoint base (default http://127.0.0.1:30000)
#   NIAH_MODEL   model name/tag the server serves (required — the served path)
#   NIAH_WORDS   comma list of context sizes in words (default 2000,8000,20000,35000)
#   NIAH_METHOD  hybrid (default) = PR-176 system+user via the DeepSeek chat
#                template PLUS a restatement after the haystack. pr176 = faithful
#                PR-176 (instruction before the haystack only; collapses on DSV4
#                at 8k+, see 224142). product = the bare continuation the
#                GLM/DSV3/Hy3/DSV4 product rows were graded on. The haystack is
#                identical in all three, so only the ask changes.
#   NIAH_MAXTOK  max_tokens for the answer (default 512 hybrid|pr176 / 64 product)
#   NIAH_MIN_TOKENS  ban EOS for the first N tokens (default 0 = off, diagnostic)
#   NIAH_SEEDS   comma list of needle-layout seeds (default 0,1,2); summary reports
#                mean/min/max across seeds to separate real accuracy from variance
#   NIAH_TIMEOUT per-request timeout seconds (default 1800)
#   NIAH_WARMUP  1 (default) = for each length, one throwaway request THEN the scored
#                request (warmup N → score N). Do not warm 16k–35k before scoring 2k:
#                a later EngineCore 500 makes earlier lengths look like found=0/10.
#                Set 0 to disable warmup. NIAH_HALT_ON_FAIL=1 (default) stops the
#                ladder after a warmup/score timeout or SSE error so a dead engine
#                does not keep printing ok / 0/10.
#   NIAH_PAIR_SLEEP_S          seconds to wait after finishing a length before the
#                              next pair (default 30). Lets KV/JIT settle; 0 disables.
#   NIAH_WARMUP_SCORE_SLEEP_S  seconds between warmup ok and the scored request
#                              (default 5). 0 disables.
#   NIAH_DS_WRAP  1 = prefix <User>/<Assistant> (not a product row)
#   NIAH_TERSE    1 = comma-separated names in order of appearance (diagnostic)
#   NIAH_STOP_BLANK  1 = request stop=["\\n\\n"] (diagnostic; cuts phase-2 dumps)

#
# Why hybrid is the default (measured 27 Aug):
#   Pro 8k, n=3, same haystack -- product 7,7,8 | pr176 0,0,0 | hybrid+tail 0,7,7
# Faithful pr176 loses the task entirely above 2k: 224142 emitted 512 tokens of
# filler WITH REPEATS and no animal at all. 224120 Flash fails the same way, one
# word then EOS. But 224190 proved the cause is NOT just instruction distance --
# at 2k the hybrid tail sits right next to generation and Pro STILL prefixes ~39
# filler words before the animals. What the product stem uniquely does is
# constrain the first generated token. hybrid therefore carries PR-176's terse
# instruction (which fixed Flash 2k, 0/10 -> 10/10 x3) AND the product stem as
# an assistant-turn prime. See HYBRID_TAIL / HYBRID_PRIME.
#
# The haystack is byte-identical in all three modes (make_haystack md5 matches
# PR-176 at 2k/8k/16k/35k), so the method changes the ask, never the exam.

# Both chat-template modes share prompt scaffolding and the recall headline.
_CHAT = METHOD in ("hybrid", "pr176")

# PR-176 verbatim (pr-176 benchmark_niah.py:50-53). Do not paraphrase — the
# "Output nothing else" clause is what stops a chatty model burning its budget
# on a preamble, which is exactly how Flash scored 0/10 at 2k on 218117.
PR176_SYSTEM = (
    "You read a word list and pick out the animals. Reply with a single "
    "comma-separated list of lowercase animal names. Output nothing else."
)
PR176_USER_PREFIX = "Find the animals in this list:\n\n"

# hybrid only. Placed AFTER the haystack so the tokens adjacent to generation
# state the task instead of being more filler.

    "Reply with a single comma-separated list of lowercase animal names. "

)
# hybrid only. Assistant-turn prefill, byte-identical to the product stem.
#
# 224190 showed the tail alone is NOT enough. Under every chat-style prompt
# DSV4-Pro first enumerates the unique FILLER vocabulary and only then reaches
# the animals: at 2k it always finishes the ~40-word list and scores 10/10 (on a
# 49-item answer), but at 8k it sometimes loops back to the start of the list
# and burns the whole 512-token cap, scoring 0/10. Tail-only recovered 2 of 3
# draws at 8k (0,7,7) versus 0 of 3 for faithful pr176 (0,0,0) — better, still
# not the product baseline of 7,7,8.
#
# Instruction POSITION was therefore only part of the story: at 2k the tail sits
# directly next to generation and the dump happens anyway. What the product stem
# uniquely does is constrain the FIRST generated token — "Animals found in the
# above list: " leaves no room for a preamble. Priming the assistant turn with
# that exact string gives PR-176's instruction the product stem's first-token
# constraint.
HYBRID_PRIME = "Animals found in the above list: "

# Text appended to the very end of the prompt, i.e. the tokens immediately before
# generation. Default "" (off) leaves every prompt byte-identical to the rows
# already scored.
#
# 225001 logged the top-5 candidates for Flash's first generated token and the
# three rungs separate cleanly:
#
#   2k  token `1` p~0.19, margin 0.13-0.50, ` elephant` in the top 5   -> 10.0/10
#   8k  token `0` p~0.22, margin 0.38-0.88, ` dolphin`/` kang`/` oct`  ->  6.0/10
#   16k token `0` p 0.40-0.71, margin 1.50-2.88, NO animal, ` none`    ->  0.0/10
#
# At 8k the needles are not merely present, they OUTRANK the prior: ` kang` and
# ` oct` sit at ranks 2-3 while the generic ` dog`/` cat` trail at 4-5, which a
# model that had not read the haystack could not produce. Retrieval works there;
# `0` wins by 0.375 nats over ` dolphin` (a 1.45x likelihood ratio) purely on
# FORMAT -- the stem "Animals found in the above list: " can be continued either
# as a count or as a list, and Flash is losing a coin flip between the two. That
# coin flip is what makes 8k swing 0-8/10 between otherwise identical runs, and
# it is why perturbing index_topk appeared to "fix" the rung without any ranking
# ever having been wrong.
#
# At 2k the same near-tie lands on `1`, which opens a numbered list and scores
# 10/10. Priming that token disambiguates the stem so the rung measures retrieval
# instead of format-guessing. It cannot help 16k, where no animal appears among
# the candidates at all -- that is a genuine retrieval failure and the two must
# not be conflated.
#

# prompt and is NOT comparable to the product rows above.

# NIAH_DS_WRAP=1 to A/B the <User>/<Assistant> curl prompt.
#

# THE TERMINATION BUG. Both models emit the real needles first and then cannot
# stop, filling the whole token budget. It is not a retrieval failure and it is
# not model-specific -- only the runaway CONTENT differs:
#
#   Flash 16k  `... 7. butterfly 8. flamingo 9. crocodile 10. penguin 11. elephant
#              12. giraffe ...` -- the retrieved list looped verbatim to the cap,
#              or an A->Z alphabet game (`umbrella`, `x-ray fish` are not animals).
#   Pro   35k  a CORRECT five-needle answer, then a ```json restatement, then
#              training-data leakage (`<|end_of_file|> data/llama-3.1-8b-it/...`).
#
# So Flash invents animals (list_precision 0.05-0.14) while Pro leaks pretraining
# text (list_precision 0.23-1.00). Both inflate `items` to 60-118 for a 10-item
# answer and both make `decoys` unreadable as a fabrication signal.
#
# Recommended set, and why each entry is safe:
#   11.                      caps a numbered list at TEN items. The grader is
#                            recall@10 / p@10, so nothing past item 10 is scored
#                            anyway -- this truncates only ungraded text. Never
#                            fires on comma-separated answers, which were already
#                            short and clean.
#   ```                      cuts the JSON/code-fence restatement.
#   <|end_of_file|> and      cut the training-data leakage seen here and in
#   <|begin_of_file_name|>   224055 section 5.
#
# Do NOT add a bare `**`: it is a live first-token candidate on Pro (` **`), so it
# would truncate legitimate bold-formatted answers.

# the write seal was attn=41 skipped=0, so this is neither transport nor
# truncation: at 8k Flash simply prefers end-of-sequence to any first word.
# 224120 is the milder form of the same thing (one word, then EOS with 510
# tokens unused).
#
# min_tokens bans EOS until N tokens are out, which turns an empty answer into a

# Every Flash failure at 8k+ opens with the SAME token: `0`. 224885 16k is the
# two-char `'0 '`; 28k/35k are `0 ## 2.2.2.2...`; 224995 8k clustered is
# `0 Animals found in the above list:` looped to the cap. So Flash answers the
# product stem with "zero animals" and then fills the budget. The degenerate loop
# may therefore be a SYMPTOM of having committed to a two-character answer with
# 512 tokens left, not an independent bug.
#
# What separates the two diagnoses is the MARGIN on that first token:
#   p(`0`) near 1.0        -> Flash genuinely concludes the list has no animals.
#                             A comprehension/attention failure, and sampling is
#                             innocent.
#   p(`0`) barely over the
#   first animal name      -> a near-tie decided by numerical noise. That also
