# NIAH_NEEDLE_BAND="lo-hi" confines all ten needles to that fraction of the
# haystack, e.g. "0.0-0.1" puts them in the first 10%. Unset (default) keeps the
# historical even spread and is byte-identical to every scored row.
#
# This exists for the indexer diagnostic, NOT for scoring. 224976/224977 measured
# where the lightning indexer selects, bucketed into ten equal depth bins, and
# Flash (fails 8k) and Pro (retrieves 8k) came out INDISTINGUISHABLE — both flat
# at ~10% per bin. The reason is this function: needles land at (i+1)/11, i.e.
# 9%, 18% ... 91%, exactly one per bin. A perfect needle-only retriever would
# therefore also produce a flat ten-bin histogram, so the measurement cannot
# separate perfect retrieval from uniform random selection.
#
# Clustering the needles breaks that degeneracy: a content-driven indexer must
# concentrate its selections in the band, while a position-driven one stays flat
# regardless of where the needles are.
#
# Any run with this set is a DIAGNOSTIC. Do not compare its found=/decoys= to
# product rows -- it is a different haystack.
